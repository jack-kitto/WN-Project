# Wireless Networks Project Implementation Structure

The [Client Folder](/client) contains the source code for the dashboard which is a React application.

The [Server Folder](server) contains a basic MVC folder structure which forms the api using Node, Express, Firebase and Prisma.

## Commands that can be run from this root folder:

`npm install` - Installs all packages specified in the package.json file for both the client and server.

`npm run start` - checks if the environment variable 'NODE_ENV' is set to production, and runs either the development version or the production version of the project accordingly.

`npm run start:dev` - Runs the development version of the project.

`npm run start:prod` - Runs the production version of the project.

`npm run build` - Runs build in the client folder.

`npm run client` - Runs the client side code.

`npm run server` - Runs the server side code.
